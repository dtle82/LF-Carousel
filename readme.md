LF FRONT-END ASSESSMENT

To help us understand how you think and how you code, we have an exercise we would like you to try.  This is essentially an evaluation of your HTML5, SCSS, JavaScript, and time management skills.

In this exercise you will be building a responsive carousel from scratch.  Before you start, please look at the requirements and reply to this email with an estimate on how long it would take for you to complete the HTML/SCSS, JavaScript, and debugging.  Once you've provided your estimate, spend up to 4 hours of that time creating the carousel.

Requirements:
You must use SCSS.
You must use ES6 JavaScript.
You can use whatever build tools you want (we used gulp/browsersync, and now use webpack), just make sure your SCSS gets compiled in to a minified CSS file and your JS gets run through Babel so it’s cross-browser compatible.
The carousel must be fully responsive and work well on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
The carousel animations must work in IE11 (our lowest supported browser).
You may use jQuery.  Do not use any premade javascript components like Flickity or any other jQuery plugins such as "Flexslider" etc.  The javascript for this carousel should be written from scratch.
Use SVG’s or an icon font library such as FontAwesome for your icons.
The carousel items must include a background image, a title, and a sentence below the title.  You can use any images and text that you wish.
The carousel must contain previous and next arrows for navigation as well as dots or similar indicators at the bottom to show the current slide and allow you to change to a different slide.
The carousel should automatically cycle between slides on a timed interval.
The carousel must slide horizontally and wrap around in an infinite loop.
Bonus items:
Create some kind of time indicator to show how much time is left before the slide will automatically advance.
When a user hovers over a slide, pause the timer so a slide will not advance while a user is interacting with it.
Instead of simple dots, create a filmstrip of thumbnails to show the available slides in the carousel.
Enable swipe interactions on mobile so you can swipe left or right to change slides.

When you reply with your estimate, please let me know when you think you'll have time to work on this.  When you've completed the exercise please reply with a link to a working demo as well a link to a GIT repo containing your source code.
